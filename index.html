But you must first decide what it is you want in your life. Do you have a dream of experiencing the life you want? Many have the dreams, but not the reality despite much searching. This course uses an amazing questionnaire to assist you to find the many surprising and deeply hidden blocks standing between you and your goals. It shows you how to dig deep to clear them; teaches you about intention and Divine Timing, followed by how to make everything in your life work for you. You are then given all the positive new Feelings you need to establish abundance in your life. Many people attempt to use ThetaHealing® to download complete financial success without first Energy-Testing themselves to find what may be blocking them. In some instances, these people become upset when they do not achieve immediate results.</p><p>In this class you will learn how to clear these possible blocks, how to make a plan, to set your intentions, and follow through on your ideas to achieve your successes. This is not a get-rich-quick manual, but rather a universal tool of self discovery to utilize your potential to become rich in all aspects of your life. For the student that is already a ThetaHealing® Instructor, completion of this class gives the Instructor the right to register at the ThetaHealing Institute of Knowledge® to become a ThetaHealing® Manifesting and Abundance Instructor.</p><p>The ThetaHealing® Manifesting and Abundance Class has the following criterion taught by a certified ThetaHealing® Instructor:</p><ul><li>Manifesting Downloads Manifesting in a Theta State</li><li>Manifest in the highest and the best way</li><li>How blocks on abundance are seldom about money.</li><li>Manifesting from the Seventh Plane:</li><li>Abundance List of Manifesting Abundance Downloads</li><li>Exercises to remove your blocks</li><li>Exercise: Divine Timing</li><li>Exercise: Remembering your Future</li><li>Exercise: See Your Future</li><li>Exercise: I am stuck exercise.</li><li>Exercise: How to create your future from the Seventh Plane</li><li>Exercise: Bless your money</li></ul><pre><code>&lt;form action=&quot;<a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr</a>&quot; method=&quot;post&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt; &lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot; name=&quot;cmd&quot; value=&quot;_s-xclick&quot;&gt; &lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot; name=&quot;hosted_button_id&quot; value=&quot;82Q5UAMX4EQSC&quot;&gt; &lt;table&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot; name=&quot;on0&quot; value=&quot;Email Address&quot;&gt;Email Address&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;os0&quot; maxlength=&quot;200&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot; name=&quot;on1&quot; value=&quot;Name&quot;&gt;Name&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;os1&quot; maxlength=&quot;200&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/table&gt; &lt;input type=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;<a href="https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_AU/i/btn/btn_buynowCC_LG.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">paypalobjects.com/en_AU/i/btn/btn_buynowCC_LG.gif</a>&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; name=&quot;submit&quot; alt=&quot;PayPal &ndash; The safer, easier way to pay online!&quot;&gt; &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;<a href="https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_AU/i/scr/pixel.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">paypalobjects.com/en_AU/i/scr/pixel.gif</a>&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt; &lt;/form&gt;</code></pre></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ls-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="72"><!-- react-empty: 73 --></div></section><section id="8" class="Section Section--components-1 Fallback title-size-large color-box-pop p-h-0 fade-in  color-bg text-align-left  colors-light colors-global " data-reactid="74"><div class="Component p-2 ls-m-l-20p ls-m-r-0 ls-w-60p max-w-0 " data-reactid="75"><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/4e4b79d5-39f2-42ce-b2af-f0429b29c006.jpg" alt="Testimonials"><p>Thank you so much for coming into my life! I have had a serious heart burn problem for years, I found out it was a lot more serious than just heartburn, I have been having a gastroscopy every year for the last 5 - 6 years at least, to find out it was very very serious. At my last gastroscopy I was told to get my next one done in 6mths, that definitely sent alarm bells ringing. Enter you Deb, you asked me to attend your basic Theta course which I did, I was so amazed I then enrolled in your next advanced course, and then your manifesting abundance, which included a lot of soul searching which was fantastic and through your teaching and practicing what I had been taught I was hoping something would work, to be honest loving it and feeling different but still not sure the old "doubting Thomas syndrome" anyway I had my 6 mthly scope yesterday, and the surgeon is delighted, the biopsy's came back clear!!! I asked him what he attributed it to and he didn't know. I did !! I am to go for a final check in 6 months, just to be sure, but I just know with my continued practice of Theta and my continued friendship and help from beautiful Deb everything is fine and my "so called problem" will be a thing of the past! Just a footnote to that, it was turning cancerous. Deb I sincerely feel you saved my life! My other fabulous story is, I dislocated my small finger about 18 months or so ago, the result being I couldn't wear my beautiful rings on that finger anymore, again I have been practicing Theta on it and the other day I was able to wear one of my rings again!!! Thank you Deb!!! I can't say enough about Deb Harding and her teaching, please if you have an opportunity to get into one of her Theta courses I really urge you to do so, it will literally change your life!! THANK YOU AGAIN DEB AND BLESS YOU FOR COMING INTO MY LIFE!!! Love Mary Bruce xx MARY BRUCE NATURAL ORGANIC SKINCARE.<br>Mary Bruce - Mary Bruce Organic Skin Care - McCrae Victoria, 6 May 2015</p><p>OMG what can I say....thank you for the incredible healing you have given me. Through the fantastic cosmic airwaves of FaceTime, you have pin pointed my life, my ailments. You have given me clear direction to where I am going according to where I have been in the past (and I am not just talking about this lifetime either) &amp; a working understanding of how to overcome &amp; deal with the massive energy shifts we on this planet are experiencing at the moment. Let the world know of your fantastic healing methods, the accuracy of your readings, &amp; the compassionate &amp; empathic nature of your being. You truly are a worker of light.<br>Lilli (Psychic/Healer), February 2015</p><p>Deb is the best to go and see for help in every way, I feel a great release of blockages, hooks and other negative things. I am more at peace, so much calmer, I have become more positive and believe that I can manifest anything to my heart desire.<br>Judith March 2014</p><p>I would like to share how amazing I feel after taking your Basic DNA course , I released blocks and beliefs that I have carried around since I was 3 years old , I have stopped allowing people to walk all over me as I now believe in my own ability's and self worth ,but most of all I am so grateful for being able to take what I have learned and use that to help others ,you have opened up a brand new beautiful world to me that before this I took this course I never believed could have exist for me .You are a truly gifted teacher and an amazing soul cant wait to join you for the advanced DNA course .<br>Amanda Taylor 30th June 2014</p><p>I undertook the ThetaHealing RHYTHM to a perfect weight course on 4/3/2012 and it has changed my life and outlook upon myself for the better in so many ways. <br>Before I commenced this amazing course, I didn't have a very flattering view of myself, nor did I really like myself. I absolutely loathed myself if I am honest, regardless of numerous people telling me positive things about myself, I just wouldn't and couldn't accept anything positive said, was beginning to push people away in every way that I could. I really needed help and this couldn't have come at a better time. I have had an issue with my weight for as long as I can remember, (I am now 29) and even though I had managed to lose weight at stages throughout my life, it always managed to find it's way back to me and my body. I became extremely active in my late 20's studying 3 martial arts and although I was exceptionally active, I couldn't manage to shift the weight to my frustration.<br>I have tried multiple diets over the years, and none managed to enable me in the long term to rid the excess weight. Dated 18th March 2012.<br>Leanne (GypsyGirl)<br>Course: Rhythm to a Perfect Weight</p><p>Deb - you are always welcome in my life! You shared an amazing, magical day with me and I will always feel happy, enlightened and blessed by the experience! xoxo<br>Julie <br>Reading</p><p>I've just had a reading with Deb Harding today. I must say, she is the first person, who really came across as genuine! No offence to the other psychics out there - but Deb really made a connection with me. And I can be a tough cookie sometimes!<br>Thank you for the reading, Deb. It gave me a lot to think about<br>('Ayesha' is Arabic for 'Youngest child'.) I am, in this life the youngest child in my family. No co-incdences, for sure!<br>Monica <br>Course: Basic DNA</p><p>Debbie is a highly intuitive Theta Healer. I have now known Deb for over 10 years and in this time Deb has proven to be a genuine and honest person.<br>I have found Deb to be compassionate and straight to the point when helping others to deal with their issues and help shift beliefs. Theta healing is a<br>great modality which has changed my life and remove beliefs that do not serve me. If you want to truly heal your life on a physical, mental and spirtual <br>level, Theta Healing is the way to go.<br>Christelle<br>Readings and Healings</p><p>Hi all I would like to say a very big Thank you to Deb for the wonderful job she did for me recently. I had been a smoker for more than half my life and Deb did hypnotherapy on me to stop smoking and I can tell you now I have not had a cigarette for over 5 weeks and do not feel like one. Although the habit of having a smoke seems to be my biggest hurdle rather than the desire, but it is much easier to break that habit when I know that I feel really very sick if I even have a drag of a smoke. So from me to you Deb. Thank you so VERY MUCH. <br>.....and it has given me back my family time with the boys. I watch a movie with them most nights before bed and sometimes even a second movie. It has really shown me how much time I spent outside trying to get away from my boys instead of spending the quality time we get now. Can not and will not go back, so will keep making the steps forward and bigger and better memories NOW. Thank you for giving me my life back XXXOOO<br>Lisa <br>NLP/Hypnosis Stop Smoking</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ls-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="76"><!-- react-empty: 77 --></div></section><section id="9" class="Section Section--components-1 Fallback title-size-large color-box-pop p-h-0 fade-in  color-bg text-align-left  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="78"><div class="Component p-2 ls-m-l-20p ls-m-r-0 ls-w-60p max-w-0 " data-reactid="79"><picture>

I asked him what he attributed it to and he didn't know. I did !! I am to go for a final check in 6 months, just to be sure, but I just know with my continued practice of Theta and my continued friendship and help from beautiful Deb everything is fine and my \"so called problem\" will be a thing of the past! Just a footnote to that, it was turning cancerous. Deb I sincerely feel you saved my life! My other fabulous story is, I dislocated my small finger about 18 months or so ago, the result being I couldn't wear my beautiful rings on that finger anymore, again I have been practicing Theta on it and the other day I was able to wear one of my rings again!!! Thank you Deb!!! I can't say enough about Deb Harding and her teaching, please if you have an opportunity to get into one of her Theta courses I really urge you to do so, it will literally change your life!!

I am to go for a final check in 6 months, just to be sure, but I just know with my continued practice of Theta and my continued friendship and help from beautiful Deb everything is fine and my \"so called problem\" will be a thing of the past! Just a footnote to that, it was turning cancerous. Deb I sincerely feel you saved my life! My other fabulous story is, I dislocated my small finger about 18 months or so ago, the result being I couldn't wear my beautiful rings on that finger anymore, again I have been practicing Theta on it and the other day I was able to wear one of my rings again!!! Thank you Deb!!! I can't say enough about Deb Harding and her teaching, please if you have an opportunity to get into one of her Theta courses I really urge you to do so, it will literally change your life!!
