# Manifesting & Abundance ThetaHealing
![27 & 28 September 2016 - Shoalwater Western Australia](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/aa5d0cff-bbb3-4597-a8e2-90c0a09fb4c2.jpg)

**Prerequisite:** Basic DNA and Advanced DNA

The truth is that we are creating our own reality and it is possible to manifest the best that the world has to offer. But you must first decide what it is you want in your life. Do you have a dream of experiencing the life you want? Many have the dreams, but not the reality despite much searching. This course uses an amazing questionnaire to assist you to find the many surprising and deeply hidden blocks standing between you and your goals. It shows you how to dig deep to clear them; teaches you about intention and Divine Timing, followed by how to make everything in your life work for you. You are then given all the positive new Feelings you need to establish abundance in your life. Many people attempt to use ThetaHealing(r) to download complete financial success without first Energy-Testing themselves to find what may be blocking them. In some instances, these people become upset when they do not achieve immediate results.

In this class you will learn how to clear these possible blocks, how to make a plan, to set your intentions, and follow through on your ideas to achieve your successes. This is not a get-rich-quick manual, but rather a universal tool of self discovery to utilize your potential to become rich in all aspects of your life. For the student that is already a ThetaHealing(r) Instructor, completion of this class gives the Instructor the right to register at the ThetaHealing Institute of Knowledge(r) to become a ThetaHealing(r) Manifesting and Abundance Instructor.
